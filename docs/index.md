## Get started

### Install

Download and install the latest UptimeRobot plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install uptimerobot
```

### Configuration

Installing the latest uptimerobot plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/uptimerobot.spc`) with a single connection named `uptimerobot`:

```hcl
connection "uptimerobot" {
  plugin       = "uptimerobot"

  # API key for your UptimeRobot account.
  # Reference: https://uptimerobot.com/api/
  # Can also be set with the UPTIMEROBOT_API_KEY environment variable.
  # api_key = "u1857235-*********592bd3c445"
}
```

- `api_key` - UptimeRobot API key. There are 3 types of api_keys for reaching the data:
  - account-specific api_key which allows using all the API methods on all the monitors of an account.
  - monitor-specific api_keys which allows using only the getMonitors method for the given monitor.
  - read-only api_key which allows fetching data with all the get\* API endpoints.
